# My first discord bot

## All this work for a cheeky meme

I am new to discord, but I recently started a server for members of my family, including my parents. One of the channels I added to the server is title "tech-support" as myself and my siblings are often helping my parents and each other with various technology related problems.

My parents and I are also fans of the [IT Crowd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/), a British television comedy show from the late 2000s. One of the running gags is that they always answer their coworker's request for tech help "have you tried turning it off and on again?"

So I decided I would try to code my own discord bot that would reply in the tech-support channel with the same "have you tried turning it off and on again" response from the show. It turned out to be not too difficult, and I learned some neat lessons along the way!

## Links

I plan on writing more about my learning experience, but for now I will leave some links to the resources I found most helpful while working on this bot.

- [Discord.js documentation](https://discordjs.guide/) - very well written and very helpful!
- [An in-depth guide on deploying your Discord.js bot on Heroku](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku) - the most well written guide I found while working on this little project.
- [Heroku's documentation on Procfiles](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) - a subject with which I was previously unfamiliar, but this Procfile turned out to be very important to finally getting everything to work!
